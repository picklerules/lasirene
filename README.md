# Project Title: lasirene

## Overview

For the third practical assignment (TP3), this project evolves from the graphical mockup created for TP2, adopting a modular approach to web development. It showcases the use of either PHP or a static site generator (e.g., Eleventy, Hugo) to build a web application that is both modular and scalable. Special attention has been given to the quality and organization of the code.

## Project Instructions

- **Modular Design:** The web application includes two main pages developed for TP2, ensuring navigability between them despite some links potentially leading nowhere.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The interface is divided into distinct components (e.g., `header.php`, `footer.njk`, `card.html`), each defined in separate files to promote reusability and maintainability.
- **CSS Organization:** Stylesheets are meticulously organized corresponding to their respective page or component, enhancing the project's cohesion and scalability.
- **Advanced CSS Features:** Usage of CSS custom properties (`var()`) for theming and `@font-face` for custom fonts ensures a modern and consistent styling approach.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different device sizes.
- **JavaScript Usage:** While minimal, JavaScript is employed under the principles of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, ensuring the application remains functional and accessible across a wide range of user experiences.
